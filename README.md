## What I've Learned

Throughout the development of TasteBit Express, I've gained proficiency in various aspects of React and its ecosystem. Here's a summary of what I've learned:

- Utilizing Parcel bundler for efficient project setup and management.
- Implementing client-side routing with react-router-dom to create dynamic, single-page applications.
- Mastering the use of React hooks for state management, side effects, and context sharing.
- Exploring UI libraries like ShimmerUI to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of applications.
- Integrating Redux for centralized state management in complex React applications.
- Leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- Writing unit tests using Jest to ensure the reliability and stability of React components and functions.
- And much more, including understanding the core concepts of React, working with functional and class components, managing component lifecycle, handling events, and organizing code efficiently.

Throughout this journey, I've not only gained theoretical knowledge but also practical experience in building robust, interactive web applications using React and its associated technologies.
